## Extracted Rules & Best Practices

### General Rules

1. Make your resume easy to read / skim

   * Single-column layout. 
   * Avoid icons, images, graphics. 
   * Use bullet points instead of paragraphs. 
   * No indentation for sections or bullets beyond the natural bullet indent. 
   * Fonts: modern, easy to read (e.g. Calibri, Bitstream Charter, Arial). 
   * Font color: black; avoid thin fonts. 
   * Don’t justify text. 
   * Sufficient white space: margins (>= 0.4"), line spacing (>= \~1.07), spacing between sections. 
   * Avoid excessive bold, italics, ALL CAPS. If used, sparingly and independently. 

2. Resume length

   * Keep it to 1 page unless \~10+ years of experience. 
   * If multiple pages, only justified if senior/staff level with broad/long experience. 

### Formatting & Sections

3. Dates

   * Use full years (e.g. 2023), avoid abbreviations. 
   * Include months if you do them, don’t mix “seasons” or semsters. 
   * Use “Present” instead of “Now”, “Ongoing” etc. 
   * Right-align dates. 
   * Use en-dashes (–) for date ranges, with space around them. 

4. Section order depends on experience level

   * For students/new grads: Education first, then Experience/Projects, then Skills. 
   * For those with work experience: Work Experience → Skills → Education (or Skills before Experience depending). 
   * Very limited experience: Education → Projects → Volunteer/Extracurriculars → Skills. 

5. Contact Information

   * Include citizenship / work visa status if relevant. 
   * If you have security clearance, list it near your name. 
   * Don’t include physical address / ZIP code. 
   * Don't include location unless it's a local job, as non-local location may bias. 
   * LinkedIn profile unnecessary. 
   * Phone number optional; if you do include it, avoid prefacing with labels (“Phone:”, etc.), omit country code for US/CA. 
   * Only one email; use modern provider; avoid college email (unless very prestigious). 
   * Display email / GitHub / portfolio in plain text, no masking, no extra labels. 

### Work Experience & Bullet Points

6. Work Experience Section

   * Title it “Work Experience” or “Experience”. Avoid labels like “Employment History”, “Professional Experience”, etc. 
   * Only include *paid* work experience; research can go here as well. 
   * Clearly mark internships, contracts. 
   * Order bullet points / positions by relevance or impressiveness. 
   * Tailor your resume per application; include relevant keywords. 
   * Include context, technical challenges, outcomes / impact. 
   * More than listing duties — list accomplishments, metrics. 

7. Bullet Points Rules

   * 1-2 lines each. Prefer 1 sentence. 
   * Order from most relevant/impressive to least. 
   * Start with strong action verb in past tense. 
   * Use STAR / XYZ / CAR frameworks:

     * STAR = Situation, Task, Action, Result 
     * XYZ = Accomplished \[X] as measured by \[Y], by doing \[Z] 
     * CAR = Challenge, Action, Result 
   * Quantify achievements where possible; move metrics toward start of bullets. 
   * Avoid pronouns (“I”, “We”, etc.). 
   * Don’t end bullets with periods. 
   * Don’t allow stray single-word line wraps; avoid hyphenation at line ends. 
   * Avoid sub-bullets unless necessary. 
   * Avoid overuse of adjectives/adverbs. 

### Skills

8. Skills Section

   * Title: “Skills” (avoid modifiers like “Technical / Relevant”) 
   * Include languages/technologies you know well; those you can reasonably demonstrate. 
   * Skills you use in bullets should match skills listed here. 
   * Do *not* include soft-skills (leadership, teamwork) here — show them via bullets. 
   * Avoid skills that are assumed or generic (typing, Word, basic IDEs). 
   * Formatting:

     * 3 lines or less, single column. 
     * Order skills by importance / relevance. 
     * Separate skills into categories (e.g. Languages, Tools, Simulation, Design Tools etc.). 
     * Use proper punctuation: commas; avoid pipes, hyphens/dashes. 

### Projects

9. Projects Section

   * Name it “Projects”. Avoid words like “Personal/Relevant/Technical/Selected Projects” etc. 
   * Include personal/student/extracurricular projects, not work-projects already in experience. 
   * Don’t use “Project” in title of each project (that’s redundant). 
   * Titles of projects should be correctly capitalized. 
   * For personal projects, roles/dates/locations less important; link portfolio / repo. 
   * Project bullets: same bullet-point style as experience (impact, metrics, etc.). Order relevance first. 
   * Prefer “real” projects: something solving real problems, being used, maintained. Not just tutorials or trivial school assignments. 

### Portfolios

10. Portfolio / GitHub / Links

    * Only include if up-to-date and with good READMEs. 
    * Tests, how to run, how to test, screenshots etc. in READMEs. 
    * If portfolio / GitHub adds no meaningful content, omit to save space. 
    * Links: don’t include full “[https://www.”](https://www.”) portions; plain URLs. 

### Bias / Excluded Content

11. Avoid content that introduces potential bias

    * Exclude age, gender, children, nationality/ethnicity, religion, political views, marital status. 

### Senior Engineers & Above (10+ Years Experience)

12. Modifications for senior level

    * Include a brief summary (less than two sentences). 
    * Have different resumes for management vs individual contributor (IC) tracks. 
    * Try not to exceed 2 pages. 
    * Emphasize soft achievements + business results. 
    * Include influence in addition to impact. 
    * Earlier work experiences can be abbreviated. 
    * Move Education down, beneath Work / Skills. 

### Career Changers

13. For those changing field / career path

    * Include a short summary explaining motivation / reason for change. 
    * Link to working projects / source code that demonstrate relevant skills. 
    * Be concise in summarizing past work (outside the new field). 
    * Keep resume short (preferably 1 page). 

### Education

14. Education Section specifics

    * Don’t include coursework unless very specialized or “really cool.” 
    * Don’t include high school. 
    * Don’t include schools not resulting in degree. 
    * Don’t include start dates; only graduation. 
    * Order degrees reverse-chronologically. 
    * GPA: include if high (above \~3.75). 
    * Display GPA with 2 decimals. Three decimal places are overkill. 
    * Once in full-time work, move Education to bottom and remove GPA unless very impressive. 
    * Don’t include school location if school name already implies location or is commonly known. 
    * Include very impressive awards/scholarships; otherwise omit. 

### Grammar & Spelling

15. Grammar / Punctuation / Proofreading

    * Spell out obscure abbreviations first time, with acronym in parentheses. Lowercase first letters as appropriate. 
    * Use grammar checks, spell-checks. 
    * Proofread with fresh eyes (friends/family) for errors. 
    * Only proper nouns are capitalized.
