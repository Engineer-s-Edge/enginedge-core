      DEPRECATED: This cronjob is suspended because news ingestion is now handled
      by the main-node service via the POST /api/news/ingest/all endpoint.
      The main-node NewsInfrastructureService provides the same functionality
      with better integration into the hexagon architecture.
      
      To trigger ingestion manually, use:
        curl -X POST http://api-gateway/api/news/ingest/all?limit=60
      
      Or enable this cronjob by setting suspend: false if you need
      standalone batch ingestion that doesn't require main-node.
spec:
  # SUSPENDED - news ingestion is handled by main-node service
  suspend: true
  # Schedule to run every 2 hours, matching the original Airflow DAG
